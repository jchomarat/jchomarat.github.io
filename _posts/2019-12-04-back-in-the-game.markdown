After a few years without bloging (R.I.P SharePointOfView back in the days), I am back. I am not saying that what I have to say will change the world, but blogging allows me to share my experience, discoveries and sometimes, best practices - and let's face it, as Albert Einstein said:

>If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough

therefore, writing will allow me to make sure I've understood what I am sharing (well there is a debat around who actually said it, but you get the point).

## What is the plan?

![Ze plan]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/2019-12-04-back-in-the-game/plan.jpg){:width="200px"}

Well, it's pretty simple:

* share open [source projects](https://github.com/jchomarat){:target="_blank"} I am involved in,
* share best practices
* share how-to on struggle I have and on which I found an *answer* or a *way to do it*
* and I'll see along the way ...

Stay tuned, and thanks for reading
