As a Software Engineer, I am a huge fan of WSL (Windows Subsystem Linux) for various reasons: scripting, automation, shell etc ... you name it. But also, as a Software Engineer, I like things to be smooth and automated.

Here are below some tips I am using to optimize, industrialize and enhance my WSL experience.

# Install a Linux distribution *wherever* I want

What bothers me the most is usually hidden steps in a process. In WSL for instance, where the hell my linux distribution is installed? Ok, I can find it, but still, I want to control that.

Also, what if I want two different instances of Ubuntu 20.04 that I've installed from the Store. Let's say I want a Python environment and a Node one. I cannot do that easily, can I? (export and import are not what I call friendly)

This is where this simple, yet, amazing tool, enters in the loop: [LxRunOffline](https://github.com/DDoSolitary/LxRunOffline). This tool unleashes the power of WSL, and adds tones of extra features to the CLI wsl. Read its documentation for the full potential. I will just present below a small use case using LxRunOffline.

Here is my *basic* need: I want to install a fresh version of Ubuntu 20.04 Focal Fossa under the c:\wsl\ubuntu.20.04 directory!

1. Go [there](https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/releases/) and download the image you want, with the following pattern: *-amd64-wsl.rootfs.tar.gz, so, in our example ubuntu-20.04-server-cloudimg-amd64-wsl.rootfs.tar.gz (this is the special version for wsl, not necessarily in the Windows Store yet) and store it under c:\wsl
2. Open ~~your favorite terminal~~ [The Windows Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal) and navigate to c:\wsl
3. Create your folder
    ```sh
    /> mkdir ubuntu.20.04
    ```
4. Run the following command
    ```sh
    />  lxrunoffline.exe i -n ubuntu.20.04 -d c:\wsl\ubuntu.20.04 -f c:\wsl\ubuntu-20.04-server-cloudimg-amd64-wsl.rootfs.tar.gz
    ```
    Input parameters are:
    * n: name (displayed in wsl CLI)
    * d: directory to install this new instance
    * f: source file to use.

    And that's it! Let's wait a little bit and you'll have a fresh installation of Focal Fossa.

You can start this instance using the following command:

```sh
/> wsl -d ubuntu.20.04
```

But of course, it starts under root, and *this is not a good practise*. Let's fix it:

```sh
/[in ubuntu.20.04]> adduser {your name}
/[in ubuntu.20.04]> usermod -aG sudo,adm {your name}
/[in ubuntu.20.04]> exit

/> wsl -d ubuntu.20.04 -u {your name}
```

And voilÃ ! You can add this as a new option in [The Windows Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal). With this approach you can have several instances of the same Linux distribution and install them wherever you want on your hard drive. 

# Industrialize your Linux instance setup

Here is another common scenario: you've been using an instance for a while, then it's getting messy, you do not want to reinstall a new one because you are not sure of all the packages you've installed, or the settings you've changed. I understand and I have two words for you: [gist](https://gist.github.com/) and script.

The idea is to keep somewhere a script where you write down every steps you are executing on your Linux instance, so that you can run it all over if necessary.

This is where [gist](https://gist.github.com/) will help us. [gist](https://gist.github.com/) allows to share code snippets, and these snippets are stored in a Github repository. Of course, you could keep your script locally, but sharing it with others gives good karma points.

Here is [mine](https://gist.github.com/jchomarat/cc97b4927050d0eff47ec501145c4a22)!

```sh
#!/bin/bash

pushd ~ > /dev/null || exit

# update repo
sudo apt-get update

# install python stuff
sudo apt-get -y install python3.8 python3-pip python3.venv

# az cli
sudo apt-get -y install azure-cli

# install posh git
sudo apt-get -y install golang-go
go get -u github.com/justjanne/powerline-go

# Append to .bashrc
cat <<EOT >> .bashrc
# nice ls and folder colors
LS_COLORS='ow=01;36;40'

# posh git
GOPATH=$HOME/go
function _update_ps1() {
    PS1="$($GOPATH/bin/powerline-go -error $?)"
}
if [ "$TERM" != "linux" ] && [ -f "$GOPATH/bin/powerline-go" ]; then
    PROMPT_COMMAND="_update_ps1; $PROMPT_COMMAND"
fi

EOT

# Create repos folders
mkdir repos

popd > /dev/null || exit
```

This *startup kit* installs 
* Python 3.8 development environment,
* Azure CLI,
* posh-git (to beautify your terminal),
* alter .bashrc to improve colorization and apply posh-git

After running this script, my terminal looks like:

![Terminal]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/2020-08-24-improve-wsl-experience/terminal.png){:width="600px"}

# Conclusion

And that's it for now. I will update this post as I come across new tips.
