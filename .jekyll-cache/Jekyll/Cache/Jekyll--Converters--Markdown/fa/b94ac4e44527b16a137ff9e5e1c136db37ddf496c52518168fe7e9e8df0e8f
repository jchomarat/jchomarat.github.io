I"L<p>After a few years without bloging (R.I.P SharePointOfView back in the days), I am back. I am not saying that what I have to say will change the world, but blogging allows me to share my experience, discoveries and sometimes, best practices - and let’s face it: as Albert Einstein said</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you can’t explain it simply, you don’t understand it well enough</p>
</blockquote>

<p>therefore, writing will allow me to make sure I’ve understood what I am sharing (well there is a debat around who actually said it, but you get the point).</p>

<h2 id="what-is-the-plan">What is the plan?</h2>

<p><img src="/assets/img/posts/2019-12-04-back-in-the-game/plan.jpg" alt="Ze plan" width="200px" /></p>

<p>Well, it’s pretty simple:</p>

<ul>
  <li>share open <a href="https://github.com/jchomarat">source projects</a> I am involved in,</li>
  <li>share best practices</li>
  <li>share how-to on struggle I have and on which I found an <em>answer</em> or a <em>way to do it</em></li>
  <li>and I’ll see along the way …</li>
</ul>

<p>Stay tuned, and thanks for reading</p>
